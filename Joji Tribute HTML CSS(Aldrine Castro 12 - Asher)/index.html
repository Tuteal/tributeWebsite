        </h2>
        <p>As his channel grew, he created more bizarre characters, the most notable of which being Pink Guy, an aptly named character consisting of Miller in a pink body suit. Periodically, Miller would upload music videos to his channel which were equally diverse in musical design and visuals, From the hip-hop beats of songs like “Pink Guy Cooks Ramen And Raps” and “Rice Balls,” to country tunes such as “White is Right,” to happy ukelele songs like “Help.” Pink Guy's fate is unknown, as TVFilthyFrank ended on an inconclusive note, him being last seen preparing for battle while Frank promoted his bible-like novel, Francis of the Filth. </p>
