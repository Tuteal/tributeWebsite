            <h2>JOJI</h2>
            <p> Born George Miller in Osaka, he built a massive online following in the early 2010s with his comedy skits (including the viral phenomenon for "Harlem Shake") before changing lanes to fully focus on music, crafting downtempo, moody reflections under the Joji moniker. Joining the 88Rising collective, he released 2017's In Tongues, a six-song EP of introspective musings and piano-based electronic explorations. Following the collaborative single "18" with Kris Wu and Rich Brian, Joji issued a deluxe version of In Tongues in early 2018 that expanded the original EP with ten more tracks, including remixes by Lapalux, Ryan Hemsworth, and Actress. That same year, he kicked off a fresh cycle with the single "Yeah Right," from his official full-length debut, Ballads 1. Released that October, the LP rose to number three on the Billboard 200 and topped the R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Second single "Slow Dancing in the Dark" was also a chart hit, earning platinum status in Australia and the U.S.

                Joji swiftly began work on his next album, releasing the gold-certified single "Sanctuary" in June 2019. Subsequent international chart hits "Run" and "Gimme Love" continued the promotion for his sophomore full-length Nectar in 2020. In addition to appearances by Omar Apollo, Lil Yachty, Yves Tumor, and Benee, Nectar also featured production by Diplo on "Daylight."</p>
